#maybe find safer default image
#maybe just suggest to search for all LICENSE filenames for user to get all subfolder ones


add how and why problems were solved like adding cmds or shortcuts or magick

check out https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://github.com/mdklatt/cookiecutter-python-app&ved=2ahUKEwio3_yNo5aPAxUsRP4FHYgVFZQQFnoECCkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0SDEf3SWiMRncvV0_lxJM8

explain GitHub desktop easily

add code to replace base python environment for new python version. maybe freeze current package state and reinstall it for new python version. explain that behavior. maybe prompt for delete with text for reinstall 

add space ontop of license file for user ro add stuff. also mentione what likely is from them and me

#maybe find safer default image
#maybe just suggest to search for all LICENSE filenames for user to get all subfolder ones
add my template to bottom to give option to users to add their part ontop
auto add python license into folder and ref sub licenses in my license
remove gitignore for after venv. apply create new folder for external after venv
auto detect that venv python veriopns does not match and conform to delete and renew. generally confirm to delete 
renmae base folder to indicate that it should be unchanged

add confirmation to all folder removal

reset_python_environment_to_default_packages
multiple pauses needed for non existing env folder?

#add check of python verison of current python folder and replace it with venv if not matching. ship python by default 

#check screenshots on phone for ideas

#add stops for no settings file defined or existing & add stop for pyhton not existing

it should abort and warn. maybe make independent from global python for start after venv setup`? anyway not reasonable?

can i have non user settings file in different drive?

#add a mode to not sync settings. maybe local seetinfgs? like for com port

install needed packages did not work for pyboson

maybe moving to local folder is not needed for setlocal?

do not close if it fuck up main start

problem if log is blocked. force replace blocked log file

make everything that deletes and saves more safe by only allowing .txt for example

add comment to set that escape character like ()& need ^ . or other way to avoid. is "" around everything or around value solujtiopn? explain that relative paths work

add full path and stop if not generated before continuing:
Error: ..\..\..\tmp.txt does not exist. Press any key to exit

make a shortcut helper file which catches all errors and deletes if non?
or maye launch them with /K and only finsh in end if no errorlevel

auto kill last process? probably not. make a non-user setting to auto kill previous process. ask? or add to file and make it kill all of them?

no error to log file for error in start_program?

for crashes in batch outer most it closes everyting? maybe somehow avoid with /K instead of /C

make checks if files exist where no error would appear anywhere and leave window open with a warning if no existing

#################################

#popup for crashes . maybe to general hidden function?

add option to copy failed install with opening tmp.txt and manually relax requirements . make pipreqs relaax auto?

Make browser Version + start with Lesezeichen 

Make pyqt5 a scroll Menü for yaml settings with restart button

No. Confirmation if python finished in gui

Add block of Ctrl c

Add relativ starters?

Add just a Code line to start batch as a setting . aka start program in CMD?

Add Syntax Checker to git and even linting?

Change icon in top left corner 

Run terminal in Browser 

##############################
For readme
##############################

 explain what everything is and that it has to keep its name
 explain that you could just use poython for settings
 add to notes that you can delete after_python_crash_code.py
 explain fork.... options
explain all advantages/features

update github top right 

explain that version ..x changes can be updated by replacing do_not_change and should not be breaking
v.xy changes should be breaking something
releases should always be stable
for breaking. explain what needs to be changed to fix.

where it looks for pyron scipts for auto install

############################################################
optional
############################################################

add code example hwo to merge settings and x symbol over icon via magicked

add single function to add args together starting from i

do GOTO :EOF instead of EXIT /B for functions

lock = threading.Lock()
with lock:
	print(f"{name} got the lock")

add option to start minimized

need an Autostart on Windows option?

option to ignore every ECHO but let python print

add a batch that update git folder. maybe only main and release. maybe propt user and disaply name and changelog(s)

add startup time or something

Let the script run in "portable" mode where all logs, configs, environments stay in a single folder -> wherever shortcut is placed also print output and let python think it is there. somehow transfer shortcut pos to batch files and python for that 

make lightweight interface instead of terminal. maybe as option or only if installed

somehow have an option to get help when having access to shortcut
-> add info to shortcuts slots

Check Git remote for updates and prompt user to pull. print at least if new verison available

Enable verbose logging or keep the terminal open on error. maybe a setting that every code waits 

add option to kill previous. maybe even for non hidden

add utilities like replace line in settings

reload imports settings function? 

somehow make echo on option switchable
import setting in beginning for that 

timestamp to log? subfolder?
same for pid?

self updatring from git option?not my code but ones that use template. like a check on Startup and asking for confirmation of update and then restart from ground 

make somehow git run generator for cloning

Bonus: Change color if there's an error (e.g., red background).

make option to not delete empty log files

make environment batches more into utilities with calls with arguments? need utilizies folder?maybe whole thing as package but with some args 

generate shrotcut to log output? -> rename functions. Maybe needed becasue taskbar adding?

move helpers i.e. utiliteid into helpers file and maybe rename utilizties and put more utilizies in

mopve output of uopdates to NUL

color in prints or even change normal prints somehow. Must also work with file verison

I guess just a number for max calling of crash handlers with 0 being accepted: adjust message printing
option for not repeat calls of crash scripts? could just retun I guess if receiving arg "crashed". no that does not work since then it gets called 0 times

a lot of small helpers to helper 
confirmation question via windows popup?
-> helper 

rename everythong from batch to more generic because it is calling generic 


add better text:
	ECHO: ##########################
	ECHO: Python crashed (see above^)
	ECHO: ##########################
at least once? in the beginnign?

add some kind of detection that code crashes immediately and that it does not spam repeatedly. or some minimum delay

auto fork option? hm maybe just actually copy via a batch file (new folder and copy (dont overwrite at all), and delete .git, shortcuts ..., dont copy basically stuff in gitignore)
But fork allows for contributing changes back to original template. Git remplate does not but allows for own forking

make pyqt5 interface available and easy to use with example. 

check if i can add stoppping of closing terminal

allow for non online package installs somehow via req.txt

see where i get errorlevel and if it translateds to parent batch. print different message if errior

do i need python -m pip or not. 
do I need to update pip or python -m

add more emptly print lines between spam

make Code somehow faster. maybe compile

add how to copy this folder

allow for local package installs somehow via req.txt

install via git package possible?

add readme in code\ folder   explain what everything is and that it has to keep its name

check if i can add stoppping of closing terminal for non pyqt5

make pyqt5 interface available and easy to use with example.

auto fork option? hm maybe just actually copy via a batch file (new folder and copy (dont overwrite at all), and delete .git)

add to notes that you can delete after_python_crash_code.py

add some kind of detection that code crashes immediately and that it does not spam repeatedly. or some minimum delay

is there any use in piping the error of the start batch file for non no-terminal mode

add option to not have any prints from batch files?
remove unnecessary echos if python return -1 ?

add better text:
ECHO: ##########################
	ECHO: Python crashed (see above^)
	ECHO: ##########################
at least once? in the beginnign?

generally have more fancy prints and color.
maybe have program Name as asci art

make unicode log output

add comment if or when "" needed or allowed.

add option to log to file aswell while terminal?

add option to log terminal output to log file. maybe replace python print? outside

test if CALL :handle_python_crash >> %log_path% 2>&1 works recuresively

test if error of batch forward for log

add more crash tests and stops everywhere 

add error log piping to all shortcuts and wherever possible. and code that deletes an empty error file at end of all codes. where to put file? is there a way to put it where it was called? i guess it would not exist either way if not called by shortcuts

need activate env for pipreqs? for correct package version for python version?
need pipreqs to install in local? for no global python 

possible to make easily old terminal closing. maybe python code in helper 

make option to copy whole folder for new project somehow 

make pyFROG and pyFLIR
