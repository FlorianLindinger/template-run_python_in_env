auto install yaml? for new generation? 

allow for local package installs somehow via req.txt

add readme in code\ folder   explain what everything is and that it has to keep its name

check if i can add stoppping of closing terminal

make pyqt5 interface available and easy to use with example. (threading?)

auto fork option? hm maybe just actually copy via a batch file (new folder and copy (dont overwrite at all), and delete .git)
But fork allows for contributing changes back to original template. Git remplate does not but allows for own forking

add to notes that you can delete after_python_crash_code.py

have option for a*b^c,a*b^c

add some kind of detection that code crashes immediately and that it does not spam repeatedly. or some minimum delay

is there any use in piping the error of the start batch file for non no-terminal mode

add option to not have any prints from batch files?

add better text:
ECHO: ##########################
	ECHO: Python crashed (see above^)
	ECHO: ##########################
at least once? in the beginnign?

make unicode log output

add comment if or when "" needed or allowed. code expects none

add incremental printing to log file.

add option to log to file aswell while terminal?

test if error of batch fowrk for log

make "nopause" required instead of any? for all files

add error log piping to all shortcuts and wherever possible. and code that deletes an empty error file at end of all codes. where to put file? is there a way to put it where it was called? i guess it would not exist either way if not called by shortcuts

need activate env for pipreqs? for correct package version for python version?

rename make_absolute_path_if_relative and use where needed -> normalize_to_abs_path

create terminate_running_program_name if running and delete afterwards? for no-terminal mode

generate link to settings.py if no yaml found. explain that somewhere

move settings.py to do_not_change? link possible? but helper file is allowed to be change actually??? make folder to package such that it can be imported with subfolder path? probably just keep since can be changed and not critical

update yaml fiel to new tamplate

change generattor to not make start in folder anymore?

auto install powershell?

error catching and deleting file not working at momem for non-terminal becasue it blocks itself->need hidden suprocess to print stuff inside. or give batch file the path of its errors that it should delete itself if no errors. can that not just be handled from inside batch file from start?

prevent called batch files from overwrititing varibales
-> add SETLOCAL to start of all batches

check if files exists for start_batch without terminal

add to all:
		@REM pause if not called by other script with "nopause" argument:
		IF NOT "%~1"=="nopause" (
			ECHO: Press any key to exit
			PAUSE >NUL 
		)

		@REM Exit program without closing a potential calling program
		EXIT /B 

add pause if nopauise tp all files

@REM function that makes path to absolute if not already
:make_absolute_path_if_relative
	SET OUTPUT=%~f1
	EXIT /B

	add ~ everywhere where "" are

make checks if files exist where no error would appear anywhere and leave window open with a warning if no existing
