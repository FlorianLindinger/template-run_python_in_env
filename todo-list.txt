add how to copy this folder

add option for yaml install?
auto install yaml? for new generation? 

allow for local package installs somehow via req.txt

add readme in code\ folder   explain what everything is and that it has to keep its name

check if i can add stoppping of closing terminal

make pyqt5 interface available and easy to use with example. (threading?)

auto fork option? hm maybe just actually copy via a batch file (new folder and copy (dont overwrite at all), and delete .git)
But fork allows for contributing changes back to original template. Git remplate does not but allows for own forking

add to notes that you can delete after_python_crash_code.py

add shortcut for auto install from .py file (but that works with excluding local imports?) :https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46419607/how-to-automatically-install-required-packages-from-a-python-script-as-necessary
import importlib.metadata, subprocess, sys
required  = {'PyQt5','PyQtWebEngine'}
installed = {pkg.metadata['Name'] for pkg in importlib.metadata.distributions()}
missing   = required - installed
if missing:
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '--upgrade', 'pip'])
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', *missing])
	
have option for a*b^c,a*b^c

add some kind of detection that code crashes immediately and that it does not spam repeatedly. or some minimum delay

is there any use in piping the error of the start batch file for non no-terminal mode

add option to not have any prints from batch files?
remove unnecessary echos if python return -1 ?

add better text:
ECHO: ##########################
	ECHO: Python crashed (see above^)
	ECHO: ##########################
at least once? in the beginnign?

make unicode log output

add comment if or when "" needed or allowed. code expects none

add incremental printing to log file.

add option to log to file aswell while terminal?


add shortcut for auto gen import for .py files (do not add yaml extra if not used)


test if CALL :handle_python_crash >> %log_path% 2>&1 works recuresively


test if error of batch fowrk for log
