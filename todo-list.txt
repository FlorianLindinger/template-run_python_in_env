add how to copy this folder

How to add option to not start terminal 

add option for yaml install?. 

allow for local package installs somehow via req.txt

add readme in code\ folder   explain what everything is and that it has to keep its name

check if i can add stoppping of closing terminal

make pyqt5 interface available and easy to use with example. (threading?)

auto fork option? hm maybe just actually copy via a batch file (new folder and copy (dont overwrite at all), and delete .git)
But fork allows for contributing changes back to original template. Git remplate does not but allows for own forking

add to notes that you can delete after_python_crash_code.py

add shortcut for auto install from .py file (but that works with excluding local imports?) :https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46419607/how-to-automatically-install-required-packages-from-a-python-script-as-necessary
import importlib.metadata, subprocess, sys
required  = {'PyQt5','PyQtWebEngine'}
installed = {pkg.metadata['Name'] for pkg in importlib.metadata.distributions()}
missing   = required - installed
if missing:
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', '--upgrade', 'pip'])
    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, '-m', 'pip', 'install', *missing])
